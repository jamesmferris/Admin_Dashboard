## Design Decisions
* The layout is split into a sidebar (fixed width) and a main content area (flexible width).
* A neumorphic design style is used to create a modern, tactile feel with soft shadows and subtle gradients.
* The color scheme uses light, neutral colors to enhance readability and reduce eye strain.
* Interactive elements (buttons, cards) have hover and active states for improved user feedback.
* The projects grid uses a responsive layout to adjust to different screen sizes.
* Icons are consistently styled and sized throughout the dashboard for visual coherence.
